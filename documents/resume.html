            <li>Determined the wear properties of Fiber Reinforced Aluminum to evaluate its usability in aircraft components </li>
            <li>Conducted a literature review to document the known material properties of FRA such as weight, strength, and wear resistance</li>
            <li>Made several modifications to the full scale wear test and increased its robustness by applying four times the original load </li>
            <li>Designed and manufactured a small scale wear test to provide additional data and to validate conclusions</li>
            <li>Designed the components of the full scale and small scale wear test using SolidWorks</li>
            <li>Machined the components of the full scale and small scale wear test on campus using a mill and a lathe</li>
